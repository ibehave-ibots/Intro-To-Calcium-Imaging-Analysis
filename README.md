## Notebooks (Planned)

1. Running Jupyter notebook 
2. Introduction to TIFF File Management with `tifffile` 
3. Basic Image Processing with Numpy and OpenCV
4. Denoising and Deconvolution 
5. CaImAn: Pre-processing (Motion Correction)
6. CaImAn: ??
7. CaImAn: 1-photon Source Extraction
8. CaImAn: 2-photon Source Extraction
9. CaImAn: Quality Control
10. CaImAn: Let's work on your own dataset! 


## Other ideas (Anything that comes to mind)

1. Registration with scikit-image
2. Deconvolution with Oasis (oasis-deconvolve)
3. CaImAn Movie Handling
4. High Pass and Low Pass Spatial Filtering with CV2
5. Making summary images with Numpy
6. CaImAn Logger
7. Handling moving in formats other than TIF
8. Loading multiple files or data collected in noncontiguous sessions
9. Loading only *n* frames of a large file with movie object `subindices`
10. Using change_params() to iteratively change params for CNMF model fitting
11. Estimates class exploration (e.g., recover raw calcium traces, background models)
12. nb_view_components customization
